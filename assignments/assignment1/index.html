  <h3>List (Assignment 1)</h3>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p>
    Before you start with Assignment 1 you'll need to do the following
    things:
  </p>za

  <ul>
    <li>
      Download and install IntelliJ IDEA. 
    </li>

    <li>
      Setup an account on <a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>.  Please follow directions
      <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS251/wiki/InstallingSoftware">here</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Overview of the List Assignment</h4>

  <p>
    The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using IntelliJ
    to develop a simple Java List class.  An List is an abstract data
    type (ADT) with operations such as get(), get(), and size(). Your task
    is to implement a list of characters in Java.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
    credit) must do the following additional work:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement the requirements of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html">Iterable</a> interface.

  </ul>
  <!--
  <p>
    As much as possible, you should avoid using loops unnecessarily in this assignment.  Instead, reuse existing methods whenever possible.
  </p>
  -->

  <p>
    As an implementation node, it may be helpful to assume that there
    is a 'dummy node' present in the list to limit the number of
    special cases in your code.  The dummy node is a node that appears
    (usually) at the head of the list and is present event if the list
    is 'empty.'
  </p>
